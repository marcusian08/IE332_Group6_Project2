# IE332_Group6_Project2

Hello! This serves as a table of contents for Team 6's work towards IE 332 Spring 2023 Project 2. 

weightedMajorityClassifier
    This file encapsulates all five algorithms in addition to the Majority Classifier itself. The file can be used to classify an image by providing the appropriate path to said image. This can be accomplished by altering line 21 as needed.
  
pixel_attack
    This file is the home of the original pixel attack algorithm. This is one of the algorithms implemented in the final majority classifier code.

  whitebox_pixel
    This file is the modeified version of the original pixel attack. Liek the first one, this algorithm was implemented in the final majority classifier code.

L0BFGS
    This file is the home of the attempted BFGS algorithm. There is a commented code skeleton in this file, which can provide context on the team's plans for the architecture and use of this algorithm, in addition to its section in the Algorithm Section.
